# Cryptography
I coded AES and SHA-1 in C++, and Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and SRP in Python as part of my cryptography learning. All codes were hard-coded.
## AES
For AES, I referred to [FIPS 197](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/197/final) and [Rijndael Cipher Animation](https://formaestudio.com/rijndaelinspector/archivos/Rijndael_Animation_v4_eng-html5.html), which explained the processes thoroughly. It was challenging initially, but implementing each step in C++ turned out to be enjoyable.
## SHA-1
SHA-1 implementation in C++ followed [FIPS 180-4](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/180-4/upd1/final). Its unique padding algorithm and internal function complexity made it a bit challenging, but the process was fun.
## Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and SRP
Using Miller-Rabin Algorithms and Fast Modular Exponentiation, I found two primes for Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and SRP implementation in Python. The focus was on correctly encrypting, decrypting, and decoding at each step, providing valuable insights into how each cryptography method works.
